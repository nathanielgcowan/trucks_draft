INTRODUCTION
------------


Trucks Draft is an CRUD, MVC app using Sinatra. This app is a custom app that is create to track a user's truck. It essentially is a basic Content Management System(CMS) using the tools that I have learned so far in the program.

INSTALLATION
------------

The bot.module is not like other Drupal modules and requires a bit more
effort than normal to get going. Unlike a regular Drupal page load, an
IRC bot has to run forever and, for reasons best explained elsewhere, this
entails running the bot through a shell, NOT through web browser access.

1. This module REQUIRES Net_SmartIRC, a PHP class available from PEAR.
   In most cases, you can simply run "pear install Net_SmartIRC".

In terminal
2. 
    ```git clone https://github.com/nathanielgcowan/trucks_draft.git```

3. 
```bundle install```

4.
```cd trucks_draft```

5.
Open your editor of choice and you are ready to go!
